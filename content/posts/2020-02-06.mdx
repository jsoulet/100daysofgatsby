MDX is a very powerfull format that is able to intreprete JSX inside a Markdown file. So that you can use the MD syntax for common text parts (title, lists, code blocks) and use JS components for dynamic content, like forms or charts.

At first, I tried to implement MDX support using several random articles. I don't know why but I couldn't make it work properly. Then I managed to finalise it thanks to the [official Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/). Once again, I can say this doc is the best I ever encountered, covering step-by-step tutorial for beginers but also lots of recipies and reference guides for advanced usages.

There's nothing more to say : if you want to add MDX support, just follow the guide !

## Remark plugins

Gatsby MDX supports Remark plugins. As far as I'm concerned, I am using two of them

- _gatsby-remark-images_: add `gatsby-image` support to Markdown images. This is the plugin I already used to for [challenge #3](/blog/2020-01-22)
- _gatsby-remark-prismjs_: PrismJS is a librairy to add syntaxe highlighting to code blocks. From now the code I may show you in the articles will be easier to read! You can have a look on an example in the [previous post](/blog/2020-02-05)

## TinaCMS support ðŸ¦™

TinaCMS doesn't handle MDX files, so I add to drop TinaCMS support... for now! While investigating I stumbled uppon this [very recent PR](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/713) that is supposed to create a new package called `gatsby-tinacms-mdx`. Even if I don't use TinaCMS to write blog posts, it is usefull to fix typos. So I hope I'll be able to reintegrate it soon. ðŸ¤ž

As an example of MDX power, here is the same contact form of the [about page](/about) that will be used to let visitors publish comments. I think it will be more relevant to have it at the layout level, but consider it as a proof of concept. ðŸ˜Ž

<ContactForm
  onSubmit={() =>
    alert(
      'I am very sorry but this form just a POC. It is not plan to make it work'
    )
  }
  initialValues={{ firstname: '', lastname: '', email: '', message: '' }}
/>
