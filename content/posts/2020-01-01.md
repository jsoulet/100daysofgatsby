Last year was crazy! I managed to make a huge step out of my confort zone. Withing this time, I learned a lot by reading blog posts or watching videos. I also got the opportunity to tests many trending technologies and tools for JavaScript development (HeadlessCMS, React Native, Cypress.io...).

I've been using React in production for almost 5 years now, and, I've been impressed by the power of GraphQL since I've heared about it in 2016. So my favorite discovery of the year 2019 can't be anything else than [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org/)! Since day one, I love the way it is changing how we're creating websites, by creating a wonderful experience for both developers and users.

These 100 days will give me the opportunity to dig deeper into Gatsby and, I hope, explore it from every angle.

See you soon.
