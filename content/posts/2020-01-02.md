title: "Challenge #1: Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch"
date: 2020-01-02
---

To be honest, when I recieved the email from Gatsby announcing the first challenge on the Jan 1st I knew I would not have tome to complete it within Jan 1st (that you NYE hanghover 😴). I barely had enough energy to create the repo on Gitlab. Faithfully, I was off on the 2nd and alone at home. That was the perfect moment!

So this blog is based on the gatsby-cli command and nothing more than a `gatsby new 100daysofgatsby`.

📝 Posts are written in Markdown. It does the job for now, but I'll certainly convert them to MDX in a near future. This way I hope to improve the rendering of some special parts of the blog posts (especially the code blocks).

👨‍🎨 The design has been kept minimalist on purpouse so I won't get polluted by lots of components to deal with, animations to synchronize, colors to pair... I simply mixed [Tailwind Toolbox's Minimal blog template](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Minimal-Blog) with [Ghostwind template](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Ghostwind) et voilà! [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is something I didn't managed to test last year, and for now it sounds very promising.

🚚 Regarding hosting, this website is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Whithin no more than 3 clicks, it was up and running with an HTTPS certificate and a push to deploy mechanism. What a great time it is to be a front-end developer!
