title: "Challenge #1: Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch"
date: 2020-01-02

To be honest, when I recieved the email from Gatsby announcing the first challenge on Jan 1st I knew I would not have time to complete it within the day (thank you NYE hanghover 😴). I barely had enough energy to create the repo on Gitlab. Faithfully, I was off today and alone at home. That was the perfect moment to start the challenge!

This blog is based on the gatsby-cli command and nothing more than a `gatsby new 100daysofgatsby`.

📝 Posts are written in Markdown. It does the job for now, but I'll certainly convert them to MDX in a near future. This way I hope to improve the rendering of some special parts of the blog posts (especially the code blocks or pictures).

👨‍🎨 The design has been kept minimalist on purpouse so I'm not polluted by components to maintain, animations to synchronize, colors to pair... I simply mixed [Tailwind Toolbox's Minimal blog template](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Minimal-Blog) with [Ghostwind template](https://github.com/tailwindtoolbox/Ghostwind) et voilà! [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is something I didn't got the opportunity to test last year. For now it sounds very promising, even if it makes className attributes a bit messy.

🚚 Regarding hosting, this website is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Whithin no more than 3 clicks, it was up and running with an HTTPS certificate and a push to deploy mechanism. My only regret is that someone already booked [100daysofgatsby.netlify.com](https://100daysofgatsby.netlify.com)... What a great time is it to be a front-end developer!
