I don't find PWA interesting... yet! It is certainly due to the fact I'm a iPhone user, browsing the web on Firefox Mobile, and those two are absolutely not made to deal with PWA. To be honest, I have also said that tablets were pure gadget and they will never be able to replace computer. The future told me I was 100% wrong and I am ready to be wrong again.

That's why I don't find this chalenge is bringing something usefull to the blog. However, Gatsby plugins made it almost free, so I had no reason not to complete it! Just install [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest/)
and [gatsby-plugin-offline](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline/)...and voil√†.

That was a really small blog post. I had a wonderfull but really sporting weekend with my rollerderby team and now I'm tired and I need to sleep.
See you next week.
