There's nothing much to say about [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-image/) pluging. Starting from a markdown blog, I just followed the few steps described in [Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-image/) to install a few plugins and I got optimized imaged in my blog posts (did I told already told you how detailed this doc is ?...ðŸ¥°)

Gatsby-image API not only compress images and creates lazy loading miniatures to display while the full image is loading, but it also gives you access to function that crop and edit the image. For instance the post banners on the blog pages are 680x400px whithout beeing cropped on tools like Photoshop.
